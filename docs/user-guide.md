### Tips for Logging

### Rest Days

If today is a rest day in your plan, you'll see a message letting you know. Take the day off—recovery is part of the process!

## Tracking Progress

The **Progress** page shows how your lifts are improving over time.

### Overview Stats

At the top you'll see:
- **Workouts this week**: How many sessions you've logged
- **Weekly volume**: Total weight lifted (sets × reps × weight)
- **Volume trend**: How this week compares to last week
- **Exercises tracked**: Total exercises with data

### Weekly Volume Chart

The main chart shows your total volume week by week. Look for:
- **Upward trends**: You're doing more work over time
- **Sudden spikes**: Might indicate too much too fast
- **Dips**: Could be deloads, rest weeks, or missed sessions

### Exercise Progress

Below the chart, exercises are grouped by muscle group. Click any exercise to see detailed charts:

1. **Top Set Weight**: Your heaviest set over time
2. **Estimated 1RM**: Calculated from your best set (Epley formula)
3. **Volume**: Total work for this exercise per session
4. **Session History**: Table of recent performances

### Understanding Suggestions

GymForge analyzes your data and provides suggestions:

- **"Ready to Progress!"**: You've been consistent—try adding weight
- **"Keep It Up!"**: You're on the right track, keep working
- **"Consider a Deload"**: You might be struggling—try reducing weight

These are guidelines, not rules. Listen to your body!

## Best Practices

### Consistency is Key

- Log every workout, even if it's not perfect
- Showing up is more important than perfect numbers

### Progressive Overload

The #1 rule for building strength:
- Add a little weight or an extra rep over time
- Don't jump too fast—2.5-5 lbs per week is great progress

### Use Rest Days

- Your muscles grow during recovery, not during workouts
- Plan 2-3 rest days per week

### Trust the Process

- Progress isn't always linear
- Bad days happen—just keep showing up
- Look at trends over weeks and months, not individual sessions

## FAQ

### Can I log workouts for past dates?

Yes! Use the date selector on the Log page to navigate to any date.

### What if I don't follow my plan exactly?

That's fine! The plan is a template. Log what you actually do.

### Can I have multiple plans?

Yes! Create new plans anytime. Only one plan is "active" at a time, but you can switch between them.

### How is Estimated 1RM calculated?

We use the Epley formula: `1RM = weight × (1 + reps/30)`

For example, if you lift 200 lbs for 8 reps:
- 1RM ≈ 200 × (1 + 8/30) ≈ 253 lbs

### Can I delete my data?

Contact support to request data deletion. We'll remove all your workout data while keeping your account.
